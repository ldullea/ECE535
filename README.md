ECE 535 Project Liam Dullea and Eric Mains

Federated Learning on Multimodal Sensor Data


Our group is suitable for taking on this project due to the fact we both are familiar and comfortable with the basics of ML and how to apply it in this setting. We both also have a background in security and data privacy as we both are in ECE545 Network Security and Privacy were we discuss how information seemingly anonymous within a dataset can actually be extracted out and connected to individuals. Given our familiarity with the topic and comfortability with the platform we would be working on (python) we are suitable for the project.

team members responsibilities, project timeline, references

  The goal of this project is for us to better understand data from a variety a sources in a dataset in a federated learning setting. The motivation for federated learning in particular is so that data can be kept private during the training process. Our deliverables will be our showing a greater understanding of federated learning, reproducing the results of the paper using their datasets, preform an per-class accuracy analysis and observe the effect of skewed data, and evaluate the system on a multimodal dataset with even class distribution. The hardware/software requirements are a laptop with a CUDA enabled GPU and python installed which we both already have. Each member will work together throughout the project, but our specific roles will be outlined below.
